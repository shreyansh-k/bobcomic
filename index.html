      Welcome to the site of the official Bob Comic!
    </h1>
    <h2>The Bob comic is a comic created to be funnier than other comics, by combining the ideas of kids!</h2>
    <h3>We are currently working on more comics, but we will be as quick as possible! We also have other books besides the Bob books, so you all have something else to read!</h3>
